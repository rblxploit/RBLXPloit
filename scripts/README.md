# Roblox-Cheats
If you have issues with the scripts or would like to contact me. You can join my discord at [https://discord.gg/MhMB3c2CBn](https://discord.gg/MhMB3c2CBn).\
Scripts that have GUI in there name, mean that they have an interface in game (Buttons and Dropdowns). The scripts that do not have GUI in the name require a Global variable to be turned on and off.\
I provide a game link at the top of every script, so there is no confusion about which game the script is for.\
The scripts in "Others" is just some scripts that other people have made that I have found usefull.\
The scripts in "Tools" are the tools that I used to make most of these scripts.\
Some scripts may have special instruction at the top. So make sure to read any special instructions.

    A:Please check and make sure that the script is for the game you are playing. By opening the link at the top of the script. Where it says "Game : https:....". This link provides the exact game the script was made for. If it is for your game then please report it here on GitHub.
